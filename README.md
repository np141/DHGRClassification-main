## Steps to run code in the program:

### 1. Install all dependencies imported in 'handrecognition.py' and 'sorting.py' into your local environment.

### 2. Run 'handrecognition.py' first and then run 'sorting.py'. 

### 3. Delete the empty unsorted folders and also remember to move the sorted video into a new folder called "Sorted Videos" to keep track of what we have covered.

### 4. Raise issues directly on Github.
